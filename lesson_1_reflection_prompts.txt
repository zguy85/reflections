How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helps show the differences in the two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It makes it easier to find and fix bugs in the program.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It is easier to find a previous version to edit, but you have to remember to commit
	each time you are finished editing.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I feel it is just how the designer designed the program.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    get log shows a list of recent commits and git diff shows what changes have been made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If the code breaks, there are previous versions of the project that are saved that
	can be easily accessed to fix the bugs.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Finishing the course.
