What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a git file. You need to initialize it so that you can create files to place in one location.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is an area that holds files that are waiting to be added to the repository
	but are currently listed in the working directory. It makes it so easy to track what is being added
	to the repository.
