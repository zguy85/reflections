What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a git file. You need to initialize it so that you can create files to place in one location.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
 repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is an area that holds files that are waiting to be added to the repository
	but are currently listed in the working directory. It makes it so easy to track what is being added
	to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	You can run a git status command to check the status of which files are ready to be committed 
	and a git diff command to check which differences have been made.
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would
 branches help?
 
	branches are helpful when you want to create multiple versions that you do not want to affect the 
	master copy of the project in case they are experimental. It allows for multiple copies of the same
	files.
