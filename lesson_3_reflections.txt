When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If I were to collaborate with other coworkers on a single project or ask someone 
  for their help in coding a specific part, remote repositories come in handy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
	You may have a commit that was added that you are unaware off (from a coworker) that
	may change part of the master copy.
