When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If I were to collaborate with other coworkers on a single project or ask someone 
  for their help in coding a specific part, remote repositories come in handy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
	You may have a commit that was added that you are unaware off (from a coworker) that
	may change part of the master copy.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Branches allow for one to work on files without changing the master branch. Clones are copies of
	the repository that are moved to a local repository. Forks are similiar to clones, except that they
	remain on GitHub.
