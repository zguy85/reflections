When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If I were to collaborate with other coworkers on a single project or ask someone 
  for their help in coding a specific part, remote repositories come in handy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
	You may have a commit that was added that you are unaware off (from a coworker) that
	may change part of the master copy.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Branches allow for one to work on files without changing the master branch. Clones are copies of
	the repository that are moved to a local repository. Forks are similiar to clones, except that they
	remain on GitHub.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	It allows for one to make changes  on the local repository, even if the user will be offline.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Now that I know of collaborating using specific software, I would have to find another service that
	offers the same service. It would be harder because we would have to work offline and communicate
	often on each change that we made and when we made them.
	
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits
 does each approach have?
 
	I would use a branch if I were to work on a new change or feature or collaborating with someone
	else. This way if there is a bug or misspelling, it can easily be fixed and the master branch
	will have no problems to worry about.
